# Jarvis: A Voice-Activated Virtual Assistant

## Project Description

Jarvis is a voice-activated virtual assistant built using Python. It leverages several libraries and APIs to perform various tasks, such as opening websites, fetching news headlines, and processing general commands with the help of OpenAI's GPT-3.5. This project demonstrates the integration of speech recognition, text-to-speech, web browsing, and AI-powered conversational abilities.
